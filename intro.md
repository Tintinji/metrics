# This is the game with Econometrics

I studied ECON5106(Advanced Applied Econometrics) in UiO, fall 2021.Here are some notes and ideas from the lectures and readings

:::{note}
The materials are heavily based on the course delivered by Zhiyang,Jia, from Statistics Norway.

## Here is a list of the content in this book.
1. Maximum likelihood
    *Underlying principle of ML(discrete case without a Likelihood function)
    *Construct a likelihood function, derive the ML estimator
    *Find out the distribution of the estimator
    *Delta method(idea and applications)
    *3 tests application(Wald,LM,LR)
    
2.Generalized moment methods
    *Underlying principle of MM and GMM
    *Analysis the notion of under-, exact, and over-identification
    *Analysis the role of the weight matrix
    *Analysis the notion of efcient GMM, and how this is obtained
    *Analysis the Wald and Hansen J-test
    *Be able to determine the functions g(), g_N(), and estimator"Î²GMM"for specific models, such as the linear regression model.
    *Explain the relationship between i) GMM and 2SLS, and ii) GMM and MLE.
